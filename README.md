Data Visualization: Choosing the Right Graphs for Employee Analysis
I explored how different types of graphs can reveal hidden insights from an employee dataset (2000+ entries, 5-6 numerical & 2-3 categorical features like Salary, Age, Department, Gender, Bonus %, and Performance Score).
Here’s how I selected the best graph types depending on the nature of data:

🔹 Bar Chart:
Used for comparing average salaries and performance scores across departments and genders.

(Categorical vs. Numerical)

🔹 Line Chart:
Perfect for showing how salary grows with years of experience.

(Trend over continuous data)

🔹 Histogram:
Helped visualize the distribution of salary and age among employees.

(Distribution of a single numerical variable)

🔹 Box Plot:
Captured salary spreads and outliers department-wise.

(Distribution + Outliers)

🔹 Scatter Plot:
Revealed relationships between years of experience and salary, bonus % and performance score.

(Numerical vs. Numerical relationship)

🔹 Heatmap:
Showed strong and weak correlations between Age, Salary, Bonus %, Experience, and Performance.

(Multi-variable correlation)

🔹 Pie Chart:
Visualized proportions of gender and department distributions.

(Categorical proportions)

🔹 Treemap:
Mapped the size of departments based on the number of employees and salary contributions.

🔍 Employee Data Analysis | SQL + Python Integration

Today, I took a significant step forward in my data analytics journey by integrating MySQL with my ongoing Employee Data Analysis project using Python and SQLAlchemy!



📌 What I accomplished:

Connected MySQL database with Python via SQLAlchemy

Imported .csv dataset of 2000+ employee records

Inserted, queried, and visualized the data directly from the database

Executed SQL-based filtering, aggregations, and cross-column insights



📈 Tools Used:

MySQL · Python · Pandas · SQLAlchemy · Seaborn · Matplotlib
