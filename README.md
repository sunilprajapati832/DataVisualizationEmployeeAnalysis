Data Visualization: Choosing the Right Graphs for Employee Analysis
I explored how different types of graphs can reveal hidden insights from an employee dataset (2000+ entries, 5-6 numerical & 2-3 categorical features like Salary, Age, Department, Gender, Bonus %, and Performance Score).
Hereâ€™s how I selected the best graph types depending on the nature of data:

ðŸ”¹ Bar Chart:
Used for comparing average salaries and performance scores across departments and genders.

(Categorical vs. Numerical)

ðŸ”¹ Line Chart:
Perfect for showing how salary grows with years of experience.

(Trend over continuous data)

ðŸ”¹ Histogram:
Helped visualize the distribution of salary and age among employees.

(Distribution of a single numerical variable)

ðŸ”¹ Box Plot:
Captured salary spreads and outliers department-wise.

(Distribution + Outliers)

ðŸ”¹ Scatter Plot:
Revealed relationships between years of experience and salary, bonus % and performance score.

(Numerical vs. Numerical relationship)

ðŸ”¹ Heatmap:
Showed strong and weak correlations between Age, Salary, Bonus %, Experience, and Performance.

(Multi-variable correlation)

ðŸ”¹ Pie Chart:
Visualized proportions of gender and department distributions.

(Categorical proportions)

ðŸ”¹ Treemap:
Mapped the size of departments based on the number of employees and salary contributions.

(Hierarchical visual representation)
